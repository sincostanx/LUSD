# LUSD: Localized Update Score Distillation for Text-Guided Image Editing

### [Paper](placeholder)

 While diffusion models show promising results in image editing given a target prompt, achieving both prompt fidelity and background preservation remains difficult. Recent works have introduced score distillation techniques that leverage the rich generative prior of text-to-image diffusion models to solve this task without additional fine-tuning. However, these methods often lack explicit regularization mechanisms and, surprisingly, struggle with tasks such as object insertion. Our investigation of these failures reveals significant variations in gradient magnitude and spatial distribution, making hyperparameter tuning highly input-specific or unsuccessful. To address this, we propose two simple yet effective modifications: attention-based spatial regularization and gradient filtering-normalization, both aimed at reducing these variations during gradient updates. Experimental results show our method outperforms state-of-the-art score distillation techniques in prompt fidelity, improving successful edits while preserving the background. Users also preferred our method over state-of-the-art techniques across three metrics, and by 58-64% overall.

## Installation

```shell
python -m venv ./envs/lusd
source envs/lusd/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Inference

### 1. Preparing inputs

Create a directory `<input_dir>` with the following structure:
```shell
<input_dir>
    - images
        - image1.jpg
        - image2.jpg
        ...
    index.csv
```
Prompts are specified in `index.csv`. Refer to `samples/` as an example.

### 2. Editing image

```shell
source envs/lusd/bin/activate
python run.py --input_dir <input_dir> --output_dir <output_dir>
```

## Evaluation
We adopt the evaluation code from [MagicBrush](https://github.com/OSU-NLP-Group/MagicBrush/tree/main/evaluation).
